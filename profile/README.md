## Experimenting with independence.

âœ¨ **Alba is an experiment.** âœ¨

Alba is yet another search engine â€“ with some key differences. Most importantly, Alba doesn't use any existing search APIs like the ones from Bing. Alba has its own index of the web. Every page you see when you search for something on Alba was crawled by "albabot" â€“ our friendly scraping-companion.

Another difference: Alba doesn't track you. No personal data is collected while using Alba. This fulfills your natural right of private browsing.

We hope you'll like Alba. Of course, we won't be able to keep up with bigger search engines and their teams, as in the end, Alba will still be "just" an experiment.

ðŸš€ Check back some time to see if Alba has launched.
